This is a simple blog with paid subscription, using Next.js, Prismic CMS, Fauna and Stripe. This was a class project of Rocketseat Bootcamp - Ignite.
The project objective was to learn how to implement a CMS and a payment API.
It uses github OAuth for user validation.
The user will only be able to access the full post if he has an active subscription, otherwise he'll only have access to a preview of the post.
